This files describes API changes in the quiz code.


=== 2.6 ===

* mod_quiz_renderer::view_best_score has been removed. (It did not do what the
  name suggested anyway.)
* quiz_groups_members_removed_handler() has been deprecated, quiz_groups_member_removed_handler()
  should be used instead.


=== 2.4 ===

* mod_quiz_renderer::finish_review_link now requires $attemptobj to be passed in
  instead of a moodle_url.


=== Earlier changes ===

* Were not documented in this way. Sorry.
